# 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## The Problem Was Found!

**Database Table Missing Survey Columns** - Your registrations table only had 4 columns instead of 22!

```
Current table: email, phone, is_vip, created_at ❌
Should have: ☝️ + owns_pet, petType, safetyWorries, etc. (18 more fields)
```

This is why mobile data wasn't saving - the database couldn't accept the survey fields!

## What You Need To Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Update Your Database
Run this command to migrate and add the missing columns:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

OR manually add columns (see DATABASE_SCHEMA_FIX.md for SQL)

### Step 2: Restart Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Mobile Registration
- Open the form on mobile
- Fill it out completely
- Submit
- **Check database** - all survey data should now be there!

## Files Fixed

✅ `server/db.ts` - Now creates complete registrations table (22 columns)
✅ `server/migrate-db.ts` - Now includes all survey fields
✅ `api/register.ts` - Already correct
✅ `server/routes.ts` - Already correct with better error logging
✅ Client-side - Already has better error handling

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check database columns:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as column_count FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'registrations';
   ```
   Should return: **22** (not 4!)

2. **Check server logs** for any errors

3. **Look at browser Network tab** for response errors

4. **Check browser console** for validation errors

## Summary

The root cause was **database schema mismatch**. Your code was trying to insert into columns that didn't exist in the database. Now that it's fixed, both desktop and mobile should work perfectly! 🎉
